# Finance API

Personal finance API built with Rust, with the goal of speeding up my ability to track and analyze my expenses. Eventually it will be connected with a separate frontend and discord bot to speed up things.

## Notes

- Build: `cargo build`
- Run: `cargo run`
- Check for compilation errors: `cargo check`
